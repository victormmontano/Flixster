## Flixster Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### ADDITIONAL
I implemented a long click option on each movie to toggle the view of each movie between only the full backdrop and the poster with  information.  The user can differentiate between popular ( > 5 stars) and not  popular by the colors of the background (green for  popular and  blue for unpopular).

### Notes
It was a challenge to refactor my view holders into their own classes to implement homogenous recycler views because I instantiated the views in my holders with the wrong id's. I also had to figure out how to place my listeners in the appropriate places to avoid null pointer exceptions. because the api calls are asynchronous.

### Open-source libraries used
